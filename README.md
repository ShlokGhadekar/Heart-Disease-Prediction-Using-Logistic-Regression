# 🚀 Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression

## 📄 Project Overview
This project implements a **Logistic Regression model** to predict heart disease using clinical data. The model is built using **Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy** and is executed in a **Google Colab Notebook**.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is `heart.csv`, which contains various medical parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more to determine the likelihood of heart disease.

## 🔄 Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Handle missing values (if any)
3. Split data into **training** and **testing** sets
4. Train a **Logistic Regression model**
5. Evaluate **accuracy** on test data
6. Predict heart disease for a sample input

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage
### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShlokGhadekar/Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Logical-Regression.git
```
### Run in Google Colab
- Open `Aiminiproj.ipynb` in **Google Colab** or **Jupyter Notebook**.
- Run all the cells to train and test the model.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍  
- Pandas 📊  
- NumPy 🔢  
- Scikit-Learn 🤖  
- Google Colab ☁️  

## 🔄 Example Output
```
Accuracy on training data: 0.85
Accuracy on test data: 0.82
The person has a heart disease.
